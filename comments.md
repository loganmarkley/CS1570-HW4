## Comments:
- Your `errorTrap` function is a bit bloated; I would have just made 1 `isValidInput` function and looped while the user input wasn't valid in the `main`.
- It's good that you know to put function templates in `.hpp` files, but you don't really need to do that yet (you'll learn about that when you guys get to class templates).
	- Also, the `#include` for the hpp should go at the bottom of the `.h` not the top.

Very well written and thought out, keep up the good work!
